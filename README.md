# RightBot_

This project stemmed out from my master's project. The idea behind the project is to make a list of the far-right profiles that are behind these campaigns. Maybe later reporting it to Twitter. 

Most likely:
> Twitter won't do anything!

But it's cool to have a dataset of people who're retweeting certain types of hate hashtags. 

If you want to check my lists, you can check them on [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/kanishkkaran)


## Implementation list:

- [x] Follow input hashtag
- [ ] Differentiate users who actually post hate content v. the people who revolt against it. 


### For the project I am using rhiver's followbot; You can find it here: (https://github.com/rhiever/TwitterFollowBot)
